# sandbox

This is a "sandbox" GitHub Repo/R Studio Project for testing purposes. 

This line is coming from GitHub online.

This would be improved with some markdown...

But we do have a GitHub Webpage! But I am still working out how to use it...

Notes from: happygitwithr.com

- Started playing with Section 19 - Test drive R Markdown from happygitwithr
    - not that great at 19.5 as I don't understand R that well. 
- Section 27 - Now I will practice resetting...
